# Fake Job Classifier (ML + Streamlit Project)

This project detects fake job postings using machine learning and provides an interactive web interface using Streamlit.

# Live Demo

[Try the App](https://fake-job-classifier-d9bcrvavmswvkfhv6buwhp.streamlit.app/)

Paste a job description and find out if it's likely **real** or **fake**.

# Features

- Classifies job descriptions as real or fake using an ML model
- Trained on [Kaggle's Fake Job Postings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction)
- Handles imbalanced data using SMOTE
- AUC score: **0.96**
- Built with: `scikit-learn`, `Streamlit`, `joblib`, `TF-IDF`
- Includes a live keyword-based fraud alert system
